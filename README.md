# Event Management API

This project provides the backend API for an Event Management Dashboard. It allows users to manage events, attendees, and tasks, making it easier to organize and track various aspects of events. The dashboard provides functionalities to create, view, update, and delete events, as well as assign tasks to attendees.

## Features

- **Event Management**: Create, update, delete, and view events with details like name, description, location, and date.
- **Attendee Management**: Add attendees to events, track tasks assigned to them, and delete attendees as needed.
- **Task Management**: Create tasks associated with events, update their status (Pending/Completed), and view tasks for each event.

## Pages in the Dashboard

1. **Events Page**: View all events, with the ability to create new events or edit and delete existing ones.
2. **Attendees Page**: View a list of all attendees, assign them to specific events, and manage their tasks.
3. **Tasks Page**: View tasks associated with each event, assign them to attendees, and update their statuses (Pending/Completed).
